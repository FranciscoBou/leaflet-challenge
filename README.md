# leaflet-challenge
Module 15 challenge


This challenge is to show my ability to use J3 Json and leaflet maps to vizualize data regarding earthquakes in the past 7 days.
Code was sourced from Expert Learning as part of any bug fixing. Also consulted Stack overflow. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38329785/leaflet-legend-not-showing
to make sure the legend work. It gave me inspiration to look for a way to make an item for the legend, and sourced the code through Learning Expert as a helping hand to any bugs that came up.
